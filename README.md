#### Exercises from *The C Programming Language*, 2nd Edition by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

In the past few months, I've started learning C. My main source of information has been K&R, which I absolutely love so far. Up until now, I've just been reading through the chapters and doing the exercises at the end of each topic conceptually in my head. Now that I've completed most of the book, and feel as though I have a pretty good grasp of C syntax and idioms, I decided to go back and actually do all of the exercises. That is what this repo is. This repo is mostly for my own use, but I figured I'd share it with everyone anyway so that you can track my progress. Enjoy!
